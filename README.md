# MTB results
I'm a mountain bike coach at my old alma mater, [Borah High School](https://borah.boiseschools.org) (Go Lions!!!). The Borah team competes in the Idaho Interscholastic Cycling League (IICL), which falls under the governance of NICA (the National Interscholastic Cycling League). I wanted a better way to visualize rider development over races and seasons, so I built this web app. It scrapes race data from IICL and NICA webpages with rvest, and displays them using Shiny. A working version of the app can be accessed at https://mtb.jeremyboyd.org.
