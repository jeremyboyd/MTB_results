I'm a mountain bike coach at my old alma mater, [Borah High School](https://borah.boiseschools.org) (Go Lions!!!). I wanted a better way to visualize rider development over races and seasons, so I built this web app. It uses [rvest](https://github.com/tidyverse/rvest) to scrape race data from webpages maintained by the Idaho Interscholastic Cycling League and the National Interscholastic Cycling League, and allows users to create visualizations in [Shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny).

A working version of the app can be accessed at https://mtb.jeremyboyd.org.
